# webhook-lite
A stripped out fork of project lifeforce


This project is a lightweight GitHub Webhook handler for triggering a shell script if a webhook comes in.
The config file can specify a different shell script for any repository


# Setup
- Clone this repository on your system
- Run an 'npm install' from the repository directory to pull down required packages
- Create your config file and shell scripts
- Use 'screen' or a project like 'pm2' to keep this service running in the background



More will be added to this README soon....
